Hangman is a terminal based game where players compete against the computer by guessing the right letters of a random word chosen by the computer. Within six tries, players have to guess all letters of the word to win the game. When the game is started, for each letter of the word an underscore ( _ ) is displayed. When the player guesses a letter that is included in the word, the respective underscore is replaced by the correctly guessed letter. For every wrong letter guessed, the player loses one try and an additional bodypart of the hangman is displayed on the rope. When all six tries have been used by the player, the final stage of the hanging man is displayed and the game is lost.

## User Experience
* As a new player who never played the game before, I want to learn the rules of the game by reading easily understandable instructions.
