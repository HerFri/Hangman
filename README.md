Visit the live application [here]

Hangman is a terminal based game where players compete against the computer by guessing the right letters of a random word chosen by the computer. Within six tries, players have to guess all letters of the game to win the game. For every wrong letter guessed, the player loses one try and an additional bodypart of the hangman is displayed on the rope. When all six tries have been used by the player, the final stage of the hanging man is displayed and the game is lost.
